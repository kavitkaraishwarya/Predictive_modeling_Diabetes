Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Diagnosis

Execu&ve Summary:
This project focused on u&lizing the dataset from the Na&onal Ins&tute of Diabetes and Diges&ve and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to predict the presence of diabetes in pa&ents based on various medical predictor variables. The two-week project involved extensive data explora&on, modeling, and repor&ng to achieve the desired outcomes.

Project Tasks:

Descriptive Analysis:
- Conducted a thorough examina&on of the dataset to understand the variables and their values. - Iden&fied missing values in specific columns (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI) and addressed them appropriately.

Data Type Analysis:
- Created a count plot to showcase the distribu&on of integer and float data type variables. - Assessed the count of variables in each data type category.

Balance of Data:
- PloQed the count of outcomes to check the balance of the data (Diabe&c or non-diabe&c). - Described findings and proposed a plan for future ac&ons based on the data balance.

Variable Rela&onships:
- U&lized histograms to visually explore rela&onships among the specified variables.
- Conducted scaQer chart analysis between pairs of variables to understand correla&ons.

Correla&on Analysis:
- Performed correla&on analysis and visually explored it using a heatmap.

Model Building Strategies:
- Developed strategies for model building, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right valida&on framework.
- Ar&culated the thought process behind selec&ng an appropriate classifica&on algorithm.

Model Applica&on:
- Applied a chosen classifica&on algorithm to build a predic&ve model for diabetes diagnosis. - Compared various models with the results from the KNN algorithm.

Classifica&on Report:
- Created a comprehensive classifica&on report, including sensi&vity, specificity, and AUC (ROC curve).
- Described the values used for these parameters and explained their significance.

Data Repor&ng:
Tableau Dashboard:
- Developed a Tableau dashboard incorpora&ng relevant chart types and metrics for effec&ve business communica&on.

Dashboard Components: 
1. Pie Chart:
- Illustrated the distribu&on of diabe&c and non-diabe&c popula&ons.
2. ScaQer Charts:
- U&lized scaQer charts to analyze rela&onships between relevant variables.
3. Histograms/Frequency Charts:
- Incorporated histograms or frequency charts to analyze the distribu&on of the data.
4. Correla&on Heatmap:
- Presented a heatmap visualizing correla&on analysis among relevant variables.
5. Age Analysis with Bubble Chart:
- Created bins for age values and analyzed different variables for each age bracket using a bubble
chart.

Conclusion:
This project successfully accomplished the tasks outlined, providing valuable insights into the dataset and delivering a predic&ve model for diabetes diagnosis. The Tableau dashboard enhances the interpretability of the results, making it a powerful tool for decision-makers in the healthcare domain.
